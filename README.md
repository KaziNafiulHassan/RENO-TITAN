# RENO-TITAN Web Application

This web application is for the RENO-Titan Project, a three-year international collaborative effort with the Magdeburg-Stendal University of Applied Sciences as the lead partner, supported by GEOS Freiberg/WISUTEC GmbH and IAF Radioecology GmbH. Under the guidance of Prof. Dr. Petra Schneider and scientist Conrad Dorer, the project focuses on improving the management of mining residues in the titanium industry in Vietnam, including sustainable resource, land, and water management, and coastal protection.

### Project Goals:
- Inventory and characterization of NORM (naturally occurring radioactive materials) residues in Vietnam, focusing on the titanium industry.
- Identify recovery and disposal options for NORM residues.
- Develop integrated waste and radiation protection regulations for NORM residues, ensuring safe use in building materials.

### Live Application
The web application is live and can be accessed at [RENO-TITAN Web Application](https://reno-titan-app.streamlit.app/).


## Features
- RENO-TITAN Homepage: Overview of the project, goals, and collaborators.
- Mineral Statistics Dashboard: Interactive dashboard with various plots analyzing titanium export data (average, max, min, and statistical plots).
- Global Mining Map: A geographical map visualizing global mining areas, including a choropleth and interactive features for mining areas.
- Interactive Land Cover Map: Displays land cover and allows for exploring environmental aspects related to mining.
